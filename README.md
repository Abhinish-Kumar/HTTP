SO that http provide us Session for sequence. 
Store state of usl between browser and server.
To detect the visitor of site , browser and server use cookie.

### For conversation of browser and server simultanuously we can add header.
HTTP Header:- Header contain every type of information about type of data and person who request with their machine.

HTTP works based on request and response pairs.


## HTTP,HTTP_2,HTTPS?
Just like other technology http is also evolving and so many new features anre added to it . For fast and secure communication between server and computer.
HTTP/1.1 is old but HTTP/2 is new and it handle 70% of web transections.
HTTP/2 is more faster and secure. It uses compression algorithm to speedup request allows for multiplexing .allows to send multiple files over connection over time. And provide an incripted connection between client and server through HTTPS.




### HTTP/1.1


1. Uncompressed header.
2. Transfers one file at a time.
